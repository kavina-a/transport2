# Speaker Notes — Smart Public Transport (Parliamentary Sub-Committee)

**Presenter:** Rasal Jayasinghe  
**Context:** Submission to Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Ancillary Business Models — Transport (Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe)  
**Tone:** Clear, credible, policy-aligned. Suitable for ministers, secretaries, and transport officials.

---

## Slide 1 — Title

- **Content:** Title, subtitle, Sub-Committee reference, your name and credentials.
- **Notes:** Introduce yourself briefly. This submission responds to the call for public views by the Sub-Committee chaired by Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe. Focus: ancillary business models, with public buses as the pilot.

---

## Slide 2 — Policy context & motivation

- **Content:** Call for public views; national goals (efficient, reliable, scalable); pilot = public buses; policy-aligned, no rush to payment/booking.
- **Notes:** Set the frame: this is a formal response to Parliament’s invitation. Emphasise alignment with government objectives and the choice of buses as the pilot.

---

## Slide 3 — The problem in public bus transport

- **Content:** Unpredictability; no single view for operators/regulators; inefficient resource use; limited data for planning and ancillary models.
- **Notes:** Keep tone factual. These are widely recognised pain points that justify an efficiency-first, data-first approach before introducing payments or booking.

---

## Slide 4 — Proposed solution overview

- **Content:** Interconnected centralised system; smart bus stands with real-time displays; transponder-based live tracking; route/schedule optimisation; data-driven operational insights.
- **Notes:** This is the high-level architecture. No booking or payment in phase one — only visibility, reliability, and data.

---

## Slide 5 — How the system works

- **Content:** 1) Transponders on buses → central platform. 2) ETA computation. 3) Smart stands display arrivals. 4) Operators/regulators use same platform. 5) Data stored for analytics and future ancillary services.
- **Notes:** Walk through the flow simply. Stress that the same data serves passengers (displays), operators (control), and government (planning and policy).

---

## Slide 6 — Why efficiency-first (no payments initially)

- **Content:** Build trust first; lower risk (no payment infra in phase one); clear value (“when does my bus come?”); foundation for later ticketing/booking/ancillary.
- **Notes:** Address the deliberate choice not to include booking or payment in phase one. Frame it as prudent and policy-friendly.

---

## Slide 7 — Technology & capability credibility

- **Content:** Cursor, Anthropic, Gemini, Google Maps API, ElevenLabs, Starlink — with one-line role each; emphasis on rapid prototyping, scalability, global-standard tech access.
- **Notes:** Present this as evidence of capability and access to world-class tools, not as hype. Suited to ministers and secretaries who care about feasibility and standards.

---

## Slide 8 — Partners and direct access

- **Content:** Grid of six partner cards: Cursor, Gemini, Google Maps API (with logos), Anthropic, ElevenLabs, Starlink (text). Subtitle: “Direct exposure and collaboration with global-standard technology partners.”
- **Notes:** This slide shows the technology partners we have direct access to. Cursor, Gemini, and Google Maps are shown with logos; Anthropic, ElevenLabs, and Starlink complete the set. Emphasise rapid prototyping and global-standard tech access.

---

## Slide 9 — Public value & business opportunities

- **Content:** Public value (predictable journeys, data for policy); operator value (fleet utilisation, data); ancillary opportunities (advertising, premium services, data products, future ticketing/booking).
- **Notes:** Tie back to the Sub-Committee’s focus on ancillary business models. Show that efficiency and data come first, then revenue options follow.

---

## Slide 10 — Pilot rollout vision

- **Content:** Phase one = one or two corridors; transponders, smart stands, central dashboard; metrics (punctuality, headway, feedback, data quality); scale and governance.
- **Notes:** Keep the pilot concrete but adaptable. Invite input from the Sub-Committee and transport officials on corridor and metric choice.

---

## Slide 11 — Next steps & collaboration ask

- **Content:** Dialogue with Sub-Committee/Ministry; contribute to pilot design (corridor, criteria, evaluation); technical input and partner connections; timeline aligned with policy and institutional arrangements.
- **Notes:** Clear ask: collaboration, not a solo pitch. Invite the Committee and officials to shape the next steps.

---

## Slide 12 — Thank you / contact

- **Content:** Thanks to Sub-Committee and Deputy Minister; your name and credentials; openness to follow-up and collaboration.
- **Notes:** Keep closing brief and professional. Offer to answer questions and provide further detail as needed.

---

## Quick reference — Core message

- **One line:** Technology-driven, efficiency-first public bus transport using smart bus stands and transponder-based live tracking; no booking or payment in phase one.
- **Ask:** Collaboration with the Sub-Committee and transport authorities to refine the proposal and design a structured pilot.
